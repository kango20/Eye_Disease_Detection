# Diabetic_Retinopathy_Detection

The objective of this project is to develop a pipeline with preprocessing, augmentation, training, prediction, and validation and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Neural Network (DNN) for image classification. This project primarily focuses on the classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) severity levels from retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that occurs in people who have diabetes. It may cause vision loss and blindness by affecting the blood vessels in the retina. It is crucial for people with diabetes to have an eye examination in order to identify and prevent diabetic retinopathy. Timely detection and appropriate management of diabetic retinopathy are crucial to preventing vision loss and improving patient outcomes. However, manual grading of the retinal images of diabetic retinopathy severity is time consuming, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an automated solution that may accurately classify retinal images into various DR severity levels.
